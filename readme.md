# What is XBRLInspector?
XBRLInspector is a Razor/Blazor application designed to show data from XBRL documents. It serves primarily as a reference application to the [Gepsio](http://www.github.com/JeffFerguson/Gepsio) assembly.

This application uses default HTML styling, since I am *terrible* at any kind of HTML/CSS design. If you are capable of making contributions in that area, by all means - contribute away! See the `contributing.md` file for information about contributing to the project.
